    "# About\n",
    "In recent years, Cloud Model 1 (CM1; http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/people/bryan/cm1/) has become a very popular tool for performing idealized studies of atmospheric phenomena. There exists very little support for computing trajectories using CM1 output, which are usually necessary to understand the processes of the atmospheric phenomena of interest. Natively, CM1 only supports 'online' forward trajectories in 2D simulations and in 3D simulation without terrain. I wrote this script because there are no adequate tools available to compute highly customizable 'offline' trajectories in simulations with terrain. This script is intended to be easily customizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can compute backward or forward trajectories (Default is backward, but can be forward with simple changes to \"Calculate Trajectories\" block)\n",
    "* Written to work with 3D model output (can be modified to work with 2D output)\n",
    "* Will work with or without terrain\n",
    "* Initial location, number, and density of parcels can be easily specified in \"Initialize Parcels\" block\n",
    "* Uses xarray and Dask to distribute memory and calculation across multiple processors\n",
    "* With modifications, can be used with WRF output (several others have already done so)\n",
    "* Comments that say \"set by user\" are specific to model output and desired trajectories"
